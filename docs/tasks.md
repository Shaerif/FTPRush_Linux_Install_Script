- [x] Refactor documentation to consolidate under `docs/` with root pointer `README.md`
- [x] Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` with detailed release notes
- [x] Add Troubleshooting section with common failure modes and fixes
- [x] Validate download URL and desktop entry/icon paths against script

### Core Features
- [x] Implement non-interactive/silent mode (`--yes`/`--silent`)
- [x] Add support for custom installation path (`--prefix`)
- [x] Add configuration backup/restore options
